  abstract      = "Classifier chains are popular and effective method to tackle
                   a multi-label classification problem. The aim of this paper
                   is to study the asymptotic properties of the chain model in
                   which the conditional probabilities are of the logistic
                   form. In particular we find conditions on the number of
                   labels and the distribution of feature vector under which
                   the estimated mode of the joint distribution of labels
                   converges to the true mode. Best of our knowledge, this
                   important issue has not yet been studied in the context of
                   multi-label learning. We also investigate how the order of
                   model building in a chain influences the estimation of the
                   joint distribution of labels. We establish the link between
                   the problem of incorrect ordering in the chain and incorrect
                   model specification. We propose a procedure of determining
                   the optimal ordering of labels in the chain, which is based
                   on using measures of correct specification and allows to
                   find the ordering such that the consecutive logistic models
                   are best possibly specified. The other important question
                   raised in this paper is how accurately can we estimate the
                   joint posterior probability when the ordering of labels is
                   wrong or the logistic models in the chain are incorrectly

                   a ranking of features showing their relevance in predicting
                   labels, which in turn allows to choose a final subset of
                   features. The procedure is based on Markov Networks and
                   allows to model the dependencies between labels and features
                   in a direct way. In the first step we build a simple network
                   using only labels and then we test how much adding a single
                   feature affects the initial network. More specifically, in
                   the first step we use the Ising model whereas the second
                   step is based on the score statistic, which allows to test a

  abstract = "Most decision tree classifiers are designed to classify the data
              with categorical or Boolean class labels. Unfortunately, many
              practical classification problems concern data with class labels
              that are naturally organized as a hierarchical structure, such as
              test scores. In the hierarchy, the ranges in the upper levels are
              less specific but easier to predict, while the ranges in the
              lower levels are more specific but harder to predict. To build a

              However, many practical classification problems need to deal with
              multi-valued and multi-labeled data. For example, a customer data
              in a tour company may have multi-valued attributes such as the
              cars, the hobbies and the houses of the customer and multiple
              labels corresponding to the tours joined before. If the company
              intends to use customers' data to build a classifier to predict
              what kinds of customers are likely to participate in what kinds
              of tours; then a requirement arises immediately is how to design

              multi-labeled data. Therefore, this research has engaged in
              developing such a new classifier. We found that the design of
              some major functions used in our classifier is different from the
              existing ones, including how to select the next splitting
              attribute, when to stop the splitting of a node, how to determine
              a node's labels, and how to predict the labels of a new data. In

  abstract    = "Most current work on classification has been focused on
                 learning froma set of instances that are associated with a
                 single label (i.e., single-label classi-fication). However,
                 many applications, such as gene functional prediction and text
                 categorization, may allow the instances to be associated with
                 multiple labels simultaneously. Multi-label classification is
                 a generalization of single-label classification, and its
                 generality makes it much more difficult to solve. Despite its
                 importance, research on multi-label classification is still
                 lacking. Common approaches simply learn independent binary
                 classifiers for each label, and do not exploit dependencies
                 among labels. Also, several small disjuncts may appear due to
                 the possibly large number of label combinations, and
                 neglecting these small disjuncts may degrade classification
                 accuracy. In this paper we propose a multi-label lazy
                 associative classifier, which progressively exploits
                 dependencies among labels. Further, since in our lazy strategy
                 the classification model is induced on an instance-based
                 fashion, the proposed approach can provide a better coverage
                 of small disjuncts. Gains of up to 24\% are observed when the

               multilabel prediction task with a team of perceptrons. The key
               idea is to train one binary classifier per label, as is
               typically done for addressing multilabel problems, but to make
               the training signal dependent on the performance of the whole

               that is based on a pairwise approach, i.e., we incrementally
               train a perceptron for each pair of classes. Our evaluation on
               four multilabel datasets shows that the multilabel pairwise
               perceptron (MLPP) algorithm yields substantial improvements over
               MMP in terms of ranking quality and overfitting resistance,
               while maintaining its efficiency. Despite the quadratic increase
               in the number of perceptrons that have to be trained, the

              assigns a vector of class values to a given vector of features.
              In this paper, this problem is tackled by a general family of
              models, called multi-dimensional Bayesian network classifiers
              (MBCs). This probabilistic graphical model organizes class and
              feature variables as three different subgraphs: class subgraph,
              feature subgraph, and bridge (from class to features) subgraph.
              Under the standard 0--1 loss function, the most probable
              explanation (MPE) must be computed, for which we provide
              theoretical results in both general MBCs and in MBCs decomposable
              into maximal connected components. Moreover, when computing the
              MPE, the vector of class values is covered by following a special
              ordering (gray code). Under other loss functions defined in
              accordance with a decomposable structure, we derive theoretical
              results on how to minimize the expected loss. Besides these
              inference issues, the paper presents flexible algorithms for
              learning MBC structures from data based on filter, wrapper and
              hybrid approaches. The cardinality of the search space is also

               to inherently take into account correlations between labels. By
               pruning these sets, PS focuses only on the most important
               correlations, which reduces complexity and improves accuracy. By
               combining pruned sets in an ensemble scheme (EPS), new label
               sets can be formed to adapt to irregular or complex data. The
               results from experimental evaluation on a variety of multi-label

               semantic scene classification, where a natural scene may contain
               multiple objects such that the scene can be described by
               multiple class labels (e.g., a field scene with a mountain in

              problems surrounding multi-label data have appeared, and
              multi-label learning has become an important area of research.
              The data gravitation model is an approach that applies the
              principles of the universal law of gravitation to resolve machine
              learning problems. One advantage of the data gravitation model,
              compared with other techniques, is that it is based on simple
              principles with high performance levels. This paper presents a
              multi-label lazy algorithm based on a data gravitation model,
              named MLDGC. MLDGC directly handles multi-label data, and
              considers each instance as an atomic data particle. The proposed
              multi-label lazy algorithm was evaluated and compared to several
              state-of-the-art multi-label lazy methods on 34 datasets. The
              results showed that our proposal outperformed state-of-the-art
              lazy methods. The experimental results were validated using
              non-parametric statistical tests, confirming the effectiveness of
              this data gravitation model for multi-label lazy learning.",

               is represented by a single instance (feature vector) while
               associated with a set of class labels. Existing approaches learn
               from multi-label data by manipulating with identical feature
               set, i.e. the very instance representation of each example is
               employed in the discrimination processes of all class labels.
               However, this popular strategy might be suboptimal as each label
               is supposed to possess specific characteristics of its own. In
               this paper, another strategy to learn from multi-label data is
               studied, where label-specific features are exploited to benefit
               the discrimination of different class labels. Accordingly, an
               intuitive yet effective algorithm named LIFT, i.e. multi-label
               learning with Label specific Features, is proposed. LIFT firstly
               constructs features specific to each label by conducting
               clustering analysis on its positive and negative instances, and
               then performs training and testing by querying the clustering
               results. Comprehensive experiments on a total of 17 benchmark
               data sets clearly validate the superiority of LIFT against other

               categorization problem, where each document may belong to
               several predefined topics simultaneously. In multi-label
               learning, the training set is composed of instances each
               associated with a set of labels, and the task is to predict the
               label sets of unseen instances through analyzing training
               instances with known label sets. In this paper, a multi-label
               lazy learning approach named ML-KNN is presented, which is
               derived from the traditional K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm.
               In detail, for each unseen instance, its K nearest neighbors in
               the training set are firstly identified. After that, based on
               statistical information gained from the label sets of these

               belonging to each possible class, maximum a posteriori (MAP)

              at September 7, 2009 in conjunction with ECML/PKDD 2009. MLD’09
              is devoted to multi-label learning, which is an emerging and
              promising research topic of machine learning. In multi-label
              learning, each example is associated with multiple labels
              simultaneously, which therefore encompasses traditional
              supervised learning (single-label) as its special case.
              Multi-label learning is related to various machine learning
              paradigms, such as classification, ranking, semi-supervised
              learning, active learning, multi-instance learning,
              dimensionality reduction, etc. Initial attempts on multi-label
              learning date back to 1999 with works on multi-label text
              categorization. In recent years, the task of learning from
              multi-label data has been addressed by a number of methods
              adapted from various popular learning techniques, such as neural
              networks, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, kernel methods,
              ensemble methods, etc. More impressively, multi-label learning
              has manifested its effectiveness in a diversity of real-world

              multi-label learning methods using 16 evaluation measures over 11
              benchmark datasets. We selected the competing methods based on

              different groups of methods and the variety of basic underlying
              machine learning methods. Similarly, we selected the evaluation

              variety of view-points. In order to make conclusions independent
              from the application domain, we use 11 datasets from different
              domains. Furthermore, we compare the methods by their efficiency
              in terms of time needed to learn a classifier and time needed to
              produce a prediction for an unseen example. We analyze the
              results from the experiments using Friedman and Nemenyi tests for
              assessing the statistical significance of differences in

                   semantic meanings. To learn from MIML examples, we propose
                   the MimlBoost and MimlSvm algorithms based on a simple
                   degeneration strategy, and experiments show that solving
                   problems involving complicated objects with multiple
                   semantic meanings in the MIML framework can lead to good
                   performance. Considering that the degeneration process may
                   lose information, we propose the D-MimlSvm algorithm which
                   tackles MIML problems directly in a regularization
                   framework. Moreover, we show that even when we do not have
                   access to the real objects and thus cannot capture more
                   information from real objects by using the MIML
                   representation, MIML is still useful. We propose the InsDif
                   and SubCod algorithms. InsDif works by transforming
                   single-instances into the MIML representation for learning,
                   while SubCod works by transforming single-label examples
                   into the MIML representation for learning. Experiments show
                   that in some tasks they are able to achieve better
                   performance than learning the single-instances or
                   single-label examples directly.",

               expressive power of such a system can be weak. We explore a new
               direct approach. It is based on a large margin ranking system
               that shares a lot of common properties with SVMs. We tested it
               on a Yeast gene functional classification problem with positive
